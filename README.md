# data-structures
Contains data structure algorithms, I worked on, in my college practical course. Sorry I couldn't upload .c files as I lost them. I did have the .rtf and .docx files made for printing them.
Below is their description. Though they do cover an algorithm, but these practicals had some customised aims, as specified in the files.
1. Binarygg.rtf - Binary search and Insertion algorithm
2. DSP6.rtf - Singly linked list
3. DSP7.rtf - Doubly linked list
4. DSP8.rtf - Infix to postfix expression conversion and evaluation
5. polyggp_4.rtf - Polynomial addition
6. radix.rtf - Radix sort algorithm
7. recursiongg.rtf - Tower of Hanoi based on recursion
8. Tree.rtf - Tree traversla using array/linked list
9. SPARSEGG.C - Sparse matrix checking and Transpose evaluation
